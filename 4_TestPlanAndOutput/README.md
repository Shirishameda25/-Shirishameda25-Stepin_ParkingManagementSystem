Test Plan:
A Test Plan is a detailed document which describes scope, strategies, approach of intended test activities that helps us determine the effort needed to validate the quality of the application under test. The test plan serves as a blueprint to conduct software testing activities as a defined process.
The proposed project is developed with the following test cases:
1.	Enter the name of region to be known in which zone it is.
2.	Details entered by the user are written into the file.
3.	Displays the zone of the region.
